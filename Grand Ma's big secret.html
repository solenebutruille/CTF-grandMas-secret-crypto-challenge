                On the 16th of September 2000, Sherlock Holmes was on its way to his holiday home in the beautiful town of Glasgow. 
                He decided to do a quick stop on the road to visit an old friend he hadn't seen in a while. What a surprise when 
                he arrived and discovered that his old friend pasted away from a heart attack a few days earlier. He got to meet 
                all her descendants which warmly welcomed him. Indeed, they needed him. Their grandma used to store in a safe a lot
                of expensive jewelries but never got the chance to say the passcode to anyone! While cleaning the house, they found 
                some clues and were wondering if Sherlock could help them find the passcode ...

                After a well-deserved drink to recover from his emotions, Sherlock took some time to look at all the clues and 
                remembered an old sentence his old friend used to always repeat: "the answer is extremelyobvious".

            <p>
                Would you be able to help Sherlock and the family to find the passcode?
